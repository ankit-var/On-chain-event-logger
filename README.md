# On-Chain Event Logger

## Description

The On-Chain Event Logger is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a decentralized and immutable solution for logging and storing events. This Move-based smart contract allows users to create permanent, timestamped records of events directly on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, authenticity, and tamper-proof data storage.

The contract features two core functions:
- **Initialize Logger**: Sets up event storage for user accounts
- **Log Event**: Records events with unique IDs, custom messages, timestamps, and automatic blockchain event emission

Each logged event is assigned a sequential ID, stored permanently on-chain, and emitted as a blockchain event for easy indexing and querying by off-chain applications.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a universal, decentralized logging infrastructure that empowers individuals, organizations, and applications to maintain transparent and verifiable records of important events. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized logging systems by providing a trustless, blockchain-based alternative that ensures data integrity and accessibility.

By leveraging the power of the Aptos blockchain, we envision a future where critical events - from supply chain milestones to academic achievements, from governance decisions to personal milestones - can be permanently recorded in an immutable ledger that no single entity can control or manipulate.

## Future Scope
